      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Hello. My name is Nolan Soo. I have often seen that people, especially my age (I am 14) struggle to engage with studying as there are other options that create more dopamine. I attempted to rectify this issue </p>
      <h2>Connection to Researchables (giant rant below by the way)</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Researchables is one branch of my overarching nonprofit known as "Passionbolt". Its plan is to help high schoolers create nonprofits. I will attempt to reach "middle class" schools, not elite schools where every parent tries to send their kid to the Ivy League. Schools where genuineness shines through but there just isn't enough knowledge or motivation. Resources either focus on the absolute ends of the spectrum, but many are left in the middle, missing crucial resources in times like today where everyone struggles. </p>
      <p>Please note that these ideas are <strong>NOT</strong>even close to being confirmed or a critique of the current educational system. I live in Irvine and went to Venado Middle School (an extremely high quality school), and I am well aware that not everyone is this lucky. What I have seen online on social media (which mainly lets negativity shine) is that many do not appreciate the current education system in the United States, especially in "lower quality" districts. Most advanced STEAM companies/nonprofits mainly serve the top 1% of districts like Irvine, leaving the rest to rot - as those top districts already have the most parents who would have their kids participate.</p>
      <h1>Passionbolt</h1>
    
    <h2>Passionbolt: A Nonprofit Incubator Network for Youth-Driven Impact</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>High school students frequently launch nonprofit projects—ranging from science fair initiatives to social-change clubs—but many dissolve quickly due to burnout, college application pressures, or organizational challenges (Polygence, 2024; Vox, 2024). Studies show high-pressure environments during senior year contribute to emotional exhaustion and demotivation, hindering sustained extracurricular commitment (MoxoCC, 2021)</p>
    
    <h3>The Challenge: Why Youth Projects Fade</h3>
    <p>External pressures—like college applications that demand portfolios instead of sustained commitments—drive students to start nonprofits for resumes, not long-term impact (Reddit, 5 mo ago) Additionally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Burnout Culture:</strong> Over 50% of teens report stress from needing an exceptional resume, with over 25% feeling burnout (Vox, 2024)</li>
        <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Senior year application fatigue leads many students to quit structured activities (MoxoCC, 2021)</li>
        <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Without peer or mentor networks, student-led nonprofits lack resilience and accountability (UCLA, 4.6 yr ago)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Evidence: Youth-Led Nonprofits Can Scale</h3>
    <p>Pandemic-era youth groups provide proof:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Farmlink, started by Gen Z students in 2020, rescued >50,000 lb of produce in its first month—and now has saved over 70 million lb, distributed ~58 million meals (Farmlink, 2023; Wikipedia, July 2025)</li>
        <li>Other student-led nonprofits like New Voters and Develop for Good launched during COVID, engaging hundreds of volunteers and high school project expansion (AP News, 2024)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Benefits of Collaboration & Support</h3>
    <p>Research consistently shows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Network & mentorship support increases persistence and civic engagement (Brandeis/UCLA, 2010–2015)</li>
        <li>Structured youth-adult partnerships boost project quality and personal development (Wikipedia: Youth-adult partnership, last month)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What Makes Passionbolt Unique</h3>

            <td>Support System</td>
            <td>Business mentors</td>
            <td>Mentorship, peer community, interclub alliances</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>No other incubator offers this structured alliance approach among student-run nonprofits.</p>
    
    <h3>Model in Action</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Incubator</strong> trains teams in leadership, budgeting, and volunteer management (Afterschool Alliance, 2024)</li>
        <li><strong>National Network Hubs</strong> connect schools by mission area (UCLA persistent community)</li>
        <li><strong>Alliances</strong> let clubs (e.g., environmental, policy) co-design and scale joint campaigns leveraging complementary strengths.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Expected Impact</h3>
    <p>If 10% of ~100,000 US high school clubs join (~10,000 nonprofits) and each serves 100 people annually, total reach ≈1 million served. That mirrors the scale of large social tech companies—except for impact, not profit.</p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Passionbolt fills a clear gap: it's the first nonprofit incubator built for high school students, designed to foster sustainable, collaborative impact. By addressing burnout causes—college pressure, isolation, and organizational inexperience—it equips teens to lead with structure, community, and purpose. Together, these elements can transform fleeting passion projects into enduring movements.</p>
    
    <h3>Special Ideas:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Innovation Fairs"</strong></li>
        <li>Scouting out high-quality ISEF projects and turning them into something bigger</li>
        <li>Business Alliances/regional webinars</li>
        <li>Voting on major ideas/livestreamed presentations + group AMAs</li>

    <h1>Researchable</h1>
    
    <h2>Research Olympiad: Making Research Skills Fun and Accessible</h2>
    <p>Research Olympiad, founded by Rishab Jain (now at Harvard), isn't about one science discipline—it's about teaching K–8 students critical research skills: close analysis, literature reviews, interdisciplinary connections, and synthesizing ideas.</p>
    
    <h3>🧩 The Problem: Why 95%+ of Students Avoid Research</h3>
    <p>Most students don't pursue research—not because they lack ability—but because the school system, societal factors, and tech habits inhibit engagement.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classrooms are often disengaging:</strong> 25–54% of K–12 students report low engagement in school; fewer than 20% strongly agree that classwork is important or relevant (Gallup, 2024).</li>
        <li><strong>Digital distractions abound:</strong> Students spend up to 35% of classroom time on screens—logging 98 minutes per day on devices—and report headaches, fatigue, and reduced focus (Randazzo et al., 2025).</li>
        <li><strong>Off-task multitasking drops performance:</strong> Using social media, texting, or unrelated browsing during class correlates with significantly lower grades (Wikipedia, 2025).</li>
        <li><strong>School systems dissuade curiosity:</strong> Rote tasks, limited interdisciplinary work, and minimal hands-on research make school feel like "busy work" (Yuldasheva, 2025).</li>
        <li><strong>Early academic identity forms early:</strong> Most students decide by end of middle school whether they're "academic"—those in disengaging schools or underfunded districts often self-identify as non‑academic (NCES; EPI).</li>
        <li><strong>Rural and low‑SES students are left behind:</strong> Schools' resources mirror neighborhood wealth; rural enrollment (≈19%) receives less funding, fewer enrichment programs, and fewer extracurricular research opportunities (Wikipedia, 2025).</li>
        <li><strong>Summer learning loss worsens disengagement:</strong> Low-SES students lose roughly 28% of reading and 34% of math gains each summer—making research even less familiar or attainable.</li>
        <li><strong>COVID deepened the gap:</strong> Pandemic-learning reversed years of progress; digital learning often failed to build engagement or research skills (Time, 2021; EdTechMag, 2023).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>All this means that over 95% of students miss meaningful research exposure, which gets reinforced by a system that demands compliance, not curiosity.</p>
    
    <h3>🔬 Researchable's Five Core Skills</h3>
    <p>Researchable brings back curiosity by teaching:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Idea creation</strong> through guided research on real problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-source literature review</strong>—young students learn to consult, synthesize, and compare.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical AI use</strong>—how to use tools without sacrificing integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Source corroboration</strong>—teaching fact-checking from a young age.</li>
        <li><strong>Team collaboration</strong>—group work to mirror real research environments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These skills are essential for every type of learning - as making connections and strong analysis is what makes the difference at any level (from professional research to working at McDonalds) in any field - not just STEAM fields - but in the humanities (which are often ignored in favor of STEAM). Also, Researchables plans to run workshops for free (video, online, and limited in-person) in order to teach these basic skills, allowing them to work on their own projects which they could eventually create a nonprofit on in Passionbolt as a middle or high schooler. Teachers deserve resources to help their students to support their always superb efforts, and students deserve the resources to learn. </p>
    <h3>🏅 Competition Format</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local/regional events</strong>—open entry, no adult coaches needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Triathlon of challenges:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Solo quiz with passages and quick-answer formats.</li>
                <li>Team passion project—50 minutes to research and present.</li>
                <li>Solo literature review—30-minute write-up.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Teams of 4 max;</strong> winners at individual, group, and school levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring live online:</strong> Quiz 35%, Project 37%, Lit Review 28%.</li>
        <li><strong>Finals:</strong> top teams compete live in debate/presentation showdowns.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>🌟 Why It's Innovative and Effective</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Active, playful learning boosts engagement</strong>—active learners perform better and fail less often in STEM (Archer & DeWitt, 2021).</li>
        <li><strong>Game-like competition appeals to disengaged Gen Z,</strong> framing learning as fun (Gallup, 2024).</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal coaching and low cost</strong> make it scalable to rural and under-resourced schools.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthening academic identity early</strong> builds long-term engagement (Archer & DeWitt, 2021).</li>
        <li><strong>Bridging DEFICITS:</strong> Teaching research and team skills combats gaps created by summer loss and pandemic learning setbacks (Randazzo et al., 2025; Time, 2021).</li>
        <li><strong>Addressing inequity systemically:</strong> reaches middle-tier kids who aren't elite but also aren't lowest-income; rural and low‑SES students get access they usually lack (Wikipedia, 2025).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>🎯 Potential Reach & Impact</h3>
    <p>If launched in 500 schools with 50 students each, Researchable reaches 25,000 students per year, teaching them research and analysis at early ages. This approach can shift how school feels—turning passive education into active exploration.</p>
    
    <h3>🔚 Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Researchable tackles the systemic dropout from curiosity—teaching core research skills through fun, collaborative competition. It addresses why 95%+ of students fail to engage—from classroom design to screen overload—and offers a new model for early, engaging, equitable research education. Teachers deserve support.</p>
